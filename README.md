Programming Fundamentals 2 Project

Math Formula Visualizer 

We will use Node class hierarchy that models arithmetic expressions with +, -, *, and / operators, variables (x), and literal values.
The goal of this project is to draw a mathematical formula (e.g., with fractions instead of /) of such expressions.
